h1. Group email plugin

p. In the search for a contact form for Dokuwiki I only found that of By Marvin
Thomas Rabe (https://github.com/marvinrabe/dokuwiki-contact) which I started
using.  However, I wanted to use it to send out email to a group of people which
is not quite supported.  I therefore started extending it, and changing the
usage somewhat.  Thus I could not contribute my changes to the existing pluging
since an update would render existing wiki pages unusable.

h2. Features

p. It is nearly the same form like that by Bob Baddeley, except:

# reCaptcha instead of "Enter HUMAN to verify."
# Captcha can be disabled.
# Improved configuration.
# Improved anti cache work-around.
# Intelligent email address checkup.
# No annoying JavaScript-alerts.
# It jumps back to the form after submitting.
# Name and email field are filled if user is logged in.

p. If you have some more ideas, feel free to contact me.

h3. Languages

p. Following languages are  available:

* English
* French (partially)
* German
* Polish (by Alex Setlak)
* Portuguese (partially)
* Russian (partially)
* Spanish (by Cristian Wente)

h2. Requirements

p. To use this Plugin you need the following system:

* PHP >= 5.1.2
* Dokuwiki >= 2009-02-14b
* reCaptcha keys (optional)

p. You can receive the needed reCaptcha keys on http://www.google.com/recaptcha.

h2. Usage 

p. The integration is the same as in the plugin by Baddeley. Simply use this code:

bc. {{contact>}}

p. This will create a contact form with a "name","email address", "subject" and "comment" field. It will send an email to whatever the default value is. If you enabled the captcha by default, than it will also show the well known reCaptcha input fields.

p. You can also specify several parameters. If you only need one parameter you simply use:

bc. {{contact>subject=Feedback from Site}}

p. or join multiple of them with a | character:

bc. {{contact>toemail=example@mail.com|subject=Feedback from Site}}

p. or email to dokuwiki users (via dokuwiki login names)

bc. {{contact>touser=dokuwikiuser}}

p. or email to dokuwiki group members (via dokuwiki group names

bc. {{contact>togroup=dokuwikigroup}}

p. Don't allow to override the sender name or email

bc. {{contact>autofrom=true}}

p. Preset a text in the email content:

bc. {{contact>content=Feedback for the wiki:}}
